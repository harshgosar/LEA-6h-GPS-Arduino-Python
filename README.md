# LEA-6h-GPS-Arduino-Python

## Getting Started
This repository contains source code for Arduino and Python interface to read GPS output (encoded in NMEA standards) and show latitude and longitude on user interface.

Instructions given here will let you execute this project on your local machine. 

You can further develop and test this project as per your need and deploy to your live system.

However, before deploying it is advisable to execute project in sandbox/staging environment and thoroughly verify multiple scenarios.

### Prerequisites to enjoy the project
<ul>
  <li>Basic knowledge of high level computer programming</li>
  <li>Basic knowledge of 'Object Orientied Programming' and languages like C++, Java, Python etc.</li>
  <li>Basic knowledge of hardware components and peripherals of computer systems, Arduino, to start with Arduino UNO, Raspberry Pi etc. </li>
  <li>Basic knowledge of working of GPS module and NMEA sentances(more info on: http://aprs.gids.nl/nmea)
  <li>Computer system with basic configurations, latest java IDE, Arduino IDE, Python IDE and any other code editing tools etc.</li> 
</ul>

### Installing
<ul>
  <li>Copy given Arduino and Python code, compile and update code if needed as per your board and GPS module, and uploaded to board</li>
  <li>Connecting GPS modules with Arduino connections</li>
  <li>Download and install: u-center - a GNSS evaluation software for Windows by U-blox (link: https://www.u-blox.com/en/product/u-center-windows)
</ul> 

## Running the tests

Test GPS module using u-center software by interfacing it with Arduino.
